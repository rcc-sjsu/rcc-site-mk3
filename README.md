## Getting Started

After cloning/pulling, run ```npm install``` to install all required libraries

To see the site, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To see another page, add its name to the url (Ex. For the committees page, you can go to http://localhost:3000/committees)

I've already set up the page structure, so you can edit your pages by opening the corresponding folder and editing `./page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
